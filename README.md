Welcome to the repository showcasing 8 useful projects related to log filtering with SQL, 
changing file permissions with Linux, file operations using Python and some Phishing Analysis.

Project 1: Log Filtering with SQL
This project demonstrates how to efficiently filter and extract relevant information from log files using SQL queries. 
By leveraging the power of SQL, you can easily analyze and retrieve specific data based on various criteria, such as timestamps, 
error codes, or specific keywords. The project includes sample log files and a step-by-step guide on how to write SQL queries 
to filter and extract desired information.

Project 2: Changing File Permissions with Linux
Understanding and managing file permissions is crucial for maintaining security and control over your system's files and directories. 
This project provides a comprehensive guide on using Linux command-line tools to modify file permissions. 
You will learn how to set read, write, and execute permissions for different user groups, as well as how to recursively change permissions 
for multiple files and directories.

Project 3: File Operations with Python
Python is a powerful programming language that offers numerous functionalities for file handling. 
In this project, you will explore how to perform common file operations using Python, including reading data from files, writing data to files, 
deleting files, and renaming files. The project provides practical examples and code snippets to help you understand and utilize Python's file 
handling capabilities effectively.
